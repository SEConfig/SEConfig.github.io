# Call for Papers

Configuration errors (also known as misconfigurations) have become one of the major causes of system failures, resulting in security vulnerabilities, application outages, and incorrect program executions.
Building tools for configuration file support, management, and verification has been an active direction of research.
As support for configuration files grows, so too does the scope of their application, for example in domains such as Infrastructure as Code.

## Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

## Submission Information

SEInfraConfig invites extended abstracts/short research papers, practice papers and experience reports, position and vision papers. 
All kinds of papers will be two to four (2–4) pages long. 
Extended abstracts (2 pages) and short research papers (4 pages) present on-going work where authors want to start a discussion and receive feedback from the community. 
Practice papers and experience reports (2–4 pages) provide insight intro problems and challenges faced in practice with possible steps for resolution and a call for further examination and discussion within the workshop. 
Position and vision papers (2–4 pages) formulate a higher level perspective and present potential directions of the field.
